# US Consumer Complaints Database Data Analysis
This project was made for COGS 108: Data Science in Practice (Winter 2018) and created using Python

## Team Members
Alex Zhou, Kevin Lim, Lena Antoine and SooHan Im

## Hypothesis
From the US Consumer Complaint Database from Septermber 26, 2015, we wanted to see whether average income and education per state had any effect on the number of complaints.

## Data
The data used for this project was obtained through:
* [data.gov's Consumer Complaints Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database#topic=consumer_navigation)
* [List of U.S. States by Income from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_income)
* [List of U.S. States by Educational Attainment from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_educational_attainment)
* [List of U.S. States and Territoties by Population from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population)

## How to Run
This project was created in Python using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

Run the commands:
```
cd \git repo storage location\
jupyter notebook
```

Open FinalProject.ipynb to examine the code.

## How to Download
On your Terminal client, run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/knlim95/US-Complaints-Data-Analysis.git
```

If for some reason you need to modify the .csv file itself, you will need to install [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
